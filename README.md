# Hamza Fareed – Software Engineering & DevOps

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m a final-year Software Engineering / Computer Science student focused on **Fullstack Development**, **Cloud Computing**, and **DevOps**. I enjoy taking ideas from zero to a working product – from backend APIs and front-end UIs to cloud deployment and automation.

Here you’ll find my projects, experiments, and learning as I grow into a professional Software Engineer / DevOps Engineer.

## 💼 Selected Projects

> I’m currently working on stronger fullstack + cloud-native projects.  
> For now, here are a few earlier projects that show my foundations in logic, game mechanics, and Python/C++.

1. **Scrolling Game (Python)**  
   A 2D scrolling game where the player avoids falling objects and collects points to progress through levels.  
   - Uses loops, collision detection, and basic game physics.  
   - Difficulty increases as the player advances.

2. **Knight Game (C++)**  
   A chess-inspired puzzle game where the goal is to move a knight to a target square using legal chess moves.  
   - Implements board representation and move validation logic.  
   - Focus on algorithmic thinking and state management.
