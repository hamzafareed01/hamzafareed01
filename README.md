## 💻 Selected Projects

> I’m currently working on more fullstack + DevOps–heavy projects (incident management tool, feature flag service, notification hub, infra-as-code). For now, here are a few earlier projects that started my journey:

1. **Knight Escape Game (C++)**  
   Turn-based game using OOP principles (classes, inheritance, polymorphism) to move a knight across a grid under chess rules.  
   - Designed data structures for movement and interactions.  
   - Wrote unit tests for mechanics to keep gameplay bug-free.

2. **School Management Portal – Microsoft Power Platform**  
   Low-code admin tool for school operations using **PowerApps** and **Power BI**.  
   - Built responsive UI with live dashboards.  
   - Integrated **PayPal** and **Azure Functions** to automate transactions with 100% traceability.  
   - Designed secure relational data models and performance review reports.

3. **Scrolling Platform Game (Python)**  
   2D platformer with collision detection and scroll-based UI.  
   - Used object-oriented design and loop-based mechanics for multiple game states.  
   - Documented logic and functions for maintainability and debugging.

4. **Image Manipulation (Python)**  
   Script that applies multiple filters/transformations and builds a collage from altered images.  
   - Practiced image processing concepts and modular design.

> 🔜 Coming soon: production-style **fullstack + DevOps** projects with Docker, CI/CD, and cloud deployment (these will replace the smaller game projects as my main portfolio).
